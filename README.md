# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird developed by Dong Nguyen blew up in popularity when it was released in 2013 on Android and iOS. I made it my mission to do a replica of the game. This is my first finished Android game. It is based on an open source gaming framework provided by Mario Zechner and Robert Green, the authors of "Beginning Android Games":

The framework can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/beginning-android-games/

I got the graphics for the game with Google image search and redrew most of the images in Gimp until I was satisfied with the quality of the replicas. I also wrote the gamelogic, that is, the classes for the bird, pipes, the scrolling mechanism, the score system, the physics and the collision detection.
