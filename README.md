# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird developed by Dong Nguyen blew up in popularity when it was released in 2013 on Android and iOS. I made it my mission to do a replica of the game. This was my first finished Android game. It is based on a gaming framework provided by Mario Zechner and Robert Green, the authors of "Beginning Android Games":
